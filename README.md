## LWJGL 3D Game Engine Proof of Concept (PoC)

This repository contains a Java proof-of-concept (PoC) for a 3D game engine built using the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL). It demonstrates basic 3D rendering with lighting and shadow effects.

### Description

This PoC showcases core functionalities of a 3D game engine using LWJGL. It includes features like:

* 3D scene rendering
* Lighting and shadow effects (specify the implemented techniques here)
* Camera control with keyboard input
* Object selection with mouse interaction
* Basic terrain loading (mention the format, e.g. heightmap)

**Note:** This is not a complete game engine but serves as a foundation for further development.

### Technologies Used

* Java
* LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library)

### Video Demonstration

A video demonstrating the running application is available on [YouTube: LWJGL Game Engine PoC](https://youtu.be/_aFmEk9cQtg?si=0S01aLVT1cjsbmK2)
