## LWJGL 3D Game Engine Proof of Concept (PoC)

This repository contains a Java-based proof-of-concept (PoC) for a 3D game engine, developed using the **Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL)**. The PoC demonstrates essential 3D rendering capabilities, including basic lighting, shadow effects, and interactive scene manipulation.

### Overview

This PoC showcases key features of a 3D game engine using LWJGL, providing a foundation for future game engine development. The following core functionalities are implemented:

- **3D Scene Rendering**: Displays objects and environments in 3D space.
- **Lighting and Shadows**: Basic lighting models with shadow effects (e.g., [specify the techniques used, such as Phong shading, shadow mapping, etc.]).
- **Camera Control**: Allows camera movement using keyboard input.
- **Object Interaction**: Enables object selection using mouse input.
- **Terrain Loading**: Loads and displays basic terrain, using [mention the format, such as heightmaps or custom terrain format].

**Note:** This is a work-in-progress and is not yet a complete game engine but serves as a stepping stone for future features and improvements.

### Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language for engine development.
- **LWJGL**: Lightweight Java Game Library for handling graphics, input, and other game-related functions.


## **The Story Behind the 3D Game Engine**

I wrote a blog post about the journey behind creating this 3D game engine. Itâ€™s not just about the codeâ€”itâ€™s a reflection on the challenges, excitement, and evolution of this project. 

If you're interested in the story of how this PoC came to be, including the motivation behind it and the obstacles faced along the way, check out my blog post:

In this post, I share the personal journey of building something from scratch and the lessons learned through the process. Itâ€™s a great read if youâ€™re curious about the experience of developing a game engine from the ground up.
